# Project
State shortly what you did during each week. Just a table with the main results is enough. Remind to upload a brief presentation (pptx?) at virtual campus. Do not modify the previous weeks code. If you want to reuse it, just copy it on the corespondig week folder.

## Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) classification
Our tuned model with the optimized parameters is **Dense SIFT with PCA and SVM clf** which obtained a Test Accuracy score of 83.02 during an Optuna optimization run.

- Step size = 18
- Number of Features = 185
- Octave Layers = 2
- k_codebook = 198
- Classifier = SVM (with RBF Kernel)
- PCA (with 109 components)
